## Description

This repository demonstrates how to create and use a custom TwinCAT library package using `tcpkg`. It includes an example `.nuspec` file, PowerShell scripts, and steps to build, install, and uninstall the package.

## Creating your NuGet Package

The completed nuget example can be found in `./src`. The steps below show you what steps were taken, these should be modified to suit your own needs. You will also find the TwinCAT library file included in the `./twincat-library-src`, which has been included for completeness. Only the files inside of src are used for the nuget package.

### 1. Setup your `.nuspec` File

You can copy, rename and edit the file provided.

```
MyCustomLibraryPackage.nuspec
```

Edit the contents in your code editor (e.g., **VS Code**):

All of the sections in the file are commented, so read through and customize as needed.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!--
  This is a sample .nuspec file for a Chocolatey/NuGet package.
-->
<package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2015/06/nuspec.xsd">
  <metadata>
    <!-- Package ID: must be unique across your feed or nuget.org -->
    <id>MyCustomLibraryPackage</id>

    <!-- Semantic versioning: major.minor.patch -->
    <version>1.2.3</version>

    <!-- Human-friendly name -->
    <title>My Custom Library Package</title>

    <!-- License file (or external license link) -->
    <licenseUrl>https://www.yourwebsite.com/license</licenseUrl>

    <!-- Should the user accept the license during install? -->
    <requireLicenseAcceptance>true</requireLicenseAcceptance>

    <!-- Icon shown in Chocolatey GUI, use a PNG file -->
    <icon>icon.png</icon>

    <!-- Tags control how your package is displayed in the UI-->
    <tags> CategoryMy&#160;Custom&#160; AllowMultipleVersions <!--
    Tags:
    - Category<Name>
        Used to organize your packages into logical categories in Chocolatey GUI or your custom feed.
        Example: "CategoryMy&#160;Custom" will be shown as "My Custom".
        Notes:
          ‚Ä¢ "Category" is stripped from the display name.
          ‚Ä¢ Use &#160; for non-breaking spaces if the category has multiple words.

    - AllowMultipleVersions
        Allows different versions of the same package to be installed side-by-side.

    - VariantXAE
        Marks this package as intended for Engineering (XAE) environments only.
        Excludes the package from Runtime (XAR) listings.
        Use this to filter visibility and relevance.

    - VariantXAR
        Marks this package as intended for Runtime (XAR) environments only.
        Excludes the package from Engineering (XAE) listings.

    - Workload
        Identifies this package as a "workload" ‚Äî typically a meta-package that groups or installs
        other packages via dependencies.

    <!-- Your actual PLC library file to install -->
    <file src="MyCustomLibraryPlcProject.library" target="tools\MyCustomLibraryPlcProject.library" />
  </files>
</package>
```

### 2. Update PowerShell Scripts

#### `./src/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1`

Change the name of the library to point to the library file name included in the src folder.

```powershell
# Define custom values
$libraryFileName = "MyCustomLibraryPlcProject.library"
```

#### `./src/tools/chocolateyUninstall.ps1`

Update the following variables:

```powershell
$libraryName = 'My Custom Library'
$version = '1.2.3'
$vendor = 'My Company'
```

This is based on the values used in your library properties.

### 3. Update the LICENCE.txt and VERIFICATION.txt

LICENSE.txt: Replace with your project's actual license terms (or reuse an existing license if appropriate). Be sure to include 3rd party licenses if your library contains 3rd party licensed content.

VERIFICATION.txt: Update the library file name.

### 4. Pack the Library

In this example we are using the folder `C:\LocalFeed` to hold the final NuGet packages. Use the command below to make your package.

```cmd
tcpkg pack "C:\Path\To\MyCustomLibraryPackage.nuspec" -o "C:\LocalFeed"
```

## Installing the Package using CLI

### 1. Add Your Custom Feed (Only once)

```cmd
tcpkg source add -n "My Local Feed" -s "C:\LocalFeed"
```

### 2. Disable Signature Verification (Only once)

```cmd
tcpkg config unset -n VerifySignatures
```

### 3. Install the Package

```cmd
tcpkg install MyCustomLibraryPackage
```

You can now access the library from TwinCAT XAE.

## Updating Your Package Version

To release a new version of your custom library package:

### 1. Replace the .library file

Overwrite the existing MyCustomLibraryPlcProject.library file with your updated version.

### 2. Update the version in the .nuspec file

Edit the <version> field in MyCustomLibraryPackage.nuspec to reflect the new version number (e.g. 1.2.4).

### 3. Update the uninstall script

In tools\chocolateyuninstall.ps1, update the $LibraryVersion to match the new version string.

### 4. Repack the package

Run the tcpkg pack command from the directory containing your .nuspec file:

```cmd
tcpkg pack "C:\Path\To\MyCustomLibraryPackage.nuspec" -o "C:\LocalFeed"
```

üí° Tip: Always increment the version number to ensure clients receive the updated package.
